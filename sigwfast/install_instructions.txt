## Compiling the SIGWfast Fortran Extension

This package uses a Fortran extension (`sigwfast`) for fast computation of the induced gravitational wave spectrum.  
To build this extension, use the provided script:

### Prerequisites

- **Fortran compiler** (e.g., `gfortran`)
- **GCC** (the script uses `gcc-14` by default; adjust if needed)
- **NumPy** (for `f2py`)
- **OpenMP** support (for parallelization)

### Compilation Steps

1. **Navigate to the directory** containing the Fortran source files and `compile_sigwfast.py`:
    ```bash
    cd gwb/sigw_fast
    ```

2. **Edit the script if needed**:
    - If you do not have `gcc-14`, change the `CC` variable in `compile_sigwfast.py` to your available GCC version (e.g., `gcc` or `gcc-13`).

3. **Run the compilation script**:
    ```bash
    python compile_sigwfast.py
    ```

4. **Check for success**:
    - If compilation is successful, you will see:  
      `Compilation successful! You can now import sigwfast in Python.`
    - If not, review the error messages and ensure all dependencies are installed.

### Notes

- The script uses `f2py` to build the Python extension from the Fortran sources.
- The compiled module will be named `sigwfast` and can be imported in your Python code.
- If you encounter issues with OpenMP or compiler flags, consult your system documentation or modify the script accordingly.
