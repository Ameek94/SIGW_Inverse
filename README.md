# SIGW_Inverse
 
Code to reconstruct the primordial curvature power spectrum from the scalar induced GW spectrum. See the examples to learn how to use the code.

Please also cite [SIGWAY](https://github.com/jonaselgammal/SIGWAY/tree/main) and [SIGWFast](https://github.com/Lukas-T-W/SIGWfast) depending on which method you use to calculate the scalar induced gravitational wave background.
